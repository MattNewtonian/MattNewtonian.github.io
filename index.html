<div class="text" schema.org-type="short-story" aria-expanded="true">
<p>The symposium’s final speaker of the day was a small dark man with an unpretentious moustache. He had known in advance that he would be the last of several people addressing the topic of “The Independent Retailer in a Mass Market Age,” and was therefore resigned to the fact that there would be little or nothing he could say at this point that would surprise – much less impress – any of the assembled company. They were all small business owners like himself who had already heard it all about rewards points and loyalty cards. They were mostly here to show off their acumen and public speaking skills to the symposium’s sponsor, the retail giant Derek Smathers.</p>

<p>They were basically lambs to the slaughter anyway; many of them believed it was only  a matter of time before Smathers’ Virago Corps, swallowed them whole. The billionaire had always maintained that he didn’t want to destroy Main Street, but “partner up” with it. And Virago had at least affected a softer, friendlier image than some of the other conglomerates that had gobbled up Mom and Pop stores, and then regional chains, and then even mid-sized national chains in a manner which had altered American commerce forever. But the difference was only a matter of style rather than degree. At least Marcus Flarion (for that was the small dark man’s name) had come here with a modicum of financial security. His store in Encino, California was still turning a profit, and now Flarion’s New and Used Records & CDs was gliding into its thirtieth anniversary in a glow of wary confidence.
</p>

<p>	Therefore his speech, delivered in a jovial light-handed style, could easily have been titled “The Secrets to my Success,” were it not that his most potent secret had insisted she be left off the list. Constance, his wife, preferred the sidelines, even though she was a successful litigator and a specialist in business law.
</p>
<p>Constance, like her husband, was also slight and unassuming. As a couple, they came across as male and female versions cast from the same mold, like a set of enchanted bookends. Just as the graying Marcus still projected a preternatural youthfulness, so too did Constance. With her firm jaw-line, the flawless column of her throat, and her light brown hair pinned back as tightly as a novitiate’s, the only hint of her sixty years was the lightly etched lines around her jade green eyes.
</p>
<p>	So now, while Marcus spoke, Constance performed what she considered her true function for the family business, She sat twelve rows back in the cavernous hotel function room, and to Marcus’ left; just close enough for her to register his micro-expressions and he to register hers, yet far enough to one side to take in a decent-sized swath of his listeners and get a feel for how he was going over. She had worked her way through college serving drinks in nightclubs and knew all about how to read a room.
</p>
<p>She also had a decent line of sight on the event’s host. Smathers, originally an ordinary-looking ma with nondescript features, in the course of amassing his billions had had himself nipped, tucked, derma-braised, and body-sculpted to a degree that now made him resemble a wax effigy of himself. His hospitable smile, which he had worn throughout the day’s proceedings, was beginning to show signs of strain, curdling, she thought, into a weary grimace.
</p>
<p>And now any second, she was thinking, that smile is going to shatter into a million pieces when Marcus says something to make him laugh – which he will, of course; it’s practically fore-ordained. For one thing, Marcus had the kind of voice one could listen to all day. It was one of the reasons she had married him in the first place. For another, he was discoursing on his favorite subject, the business he had built from the ground up more or less on his own, with a little help from his first –and now deceased wife, and his enthusiasm was infectious. The only advice Constance had offered him was to focus on specifics. Everyone else would probably numb the audience half to death with formulas and algorithms, she’d said –a prediction that had turned out to be true. So let them know you have a very colorful product.
</p>
<p>	At one point in mid-sentence, Marcus looked pointedly at her, and Constance held up three fingers, the number of minutes remaining in his allotted time. “. . . There are many cross-promotional schemes you can utilize,” he was saying now. “We’re situated in one of the world’s greatest cities for music, after all. Every struggling band and artist has a website or a Facebook page, and it only costs us pennies to post a banner ad and a link to our store. Our lease doesn’t allow us to have in-store performances featuring emerging acts, so we do the next best thing: a release day party for an artist’s new album. The musicians come and sign the records, the fans turn out and buy the records. We actually set a store record one Sunday and moved almost eleven hundred units of one of the deluxe vinyl reissues of Christian Death . . .” Here, he paused, distracted by a flutter of nervous laughter and some remark – inaudible to Constance. Addressing the person individually, Marcus said, “yes, Ma’am, that’s an actual band,” and then to the audience in general, “we do a healthy business with the Industrial, the Heavy Metal, and its off-shoots, the Black Metal, the Death Metal. We got your Carpathian Forest, your Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Venom, Anthrax . . .” This litany gradually gave rise to mounting laughter. It was the contrast, of course, between the ferocity of the names, and the dapper little straight-arrow enunciating them.
</p>
<p>	“. . . Obituary,” Marcus continued, “Cannibal Corpse, A Place to Bury Strangers, and of course Corpsegrinder.” He raised his voice slightly to quell the disruption. “Look, it’s Basic Marketing 101, right? You find a previously underserved niche market, and you build a little nest for it.” Here, he paused and shrugged. “Sometimes, it just happens to be sort of a dark and nasty little nest.”
</p>
<p>	Oh, this they loved! Marcus had laid the perfect capstone atop his improvisation, and Constance watched as Derek Smathers’ face practically split in half. Marcus very curtly thanked the audience and his sponsor, knowing the importance of getting out fast after a laugh, and “The Independent Retailer in a Mass Market Age” ended on a high note.
</p>
<p>The closing night dinner was scheduled to begin soon in a banquet hall several floors above the function room they were now exiting. Constance and Marcus got separated in the press of bodies surrounding the elevator, and Constance found herself riding up alone. When she got off, she found the usual stretch of tables staffed by volunteers, where she presented her pass, and was handed place cards and a table number. She would have preferred to wait near the entrance for her husband to catch up, but there appeared to be a group consensus among the staff that everybody be seated as promptly as possible. She found her table situated close to the panoramic window which ran the full length of the room, framing a spectacular view of the mountains beyond Seattle. Bright shards of late afternoon sunlight sliced through heaps of cumulus dollops to tint the landscape with a silvery burnish that reminded her of those laser prints that were popular in the eighties. Mount Rainier shone so vividly, and seemed so near, that she felt as if she could land a paper airplane on its summit.
</p>
<p>The couple already seated at the table looked equally entranced by the view, then politely turned their attention to Constance as she sat down. Introductions were made. They were a pair of apple-cheeked grandparents, hailing – to no one’s surprise – that great retirement mecca of Scottsdale, Arizona. Marcus would have described their look as crunchy, taking in the woman’s feathered earrings, and the man’s bolo tie, which was yoked by something that looked like a Navajo fetish. Constance took a liking to them on the spot, which had more than a little to do with their looking like the oldest couple in the whole lot, therefore rendering Constance and her husband a respectable second-place showing. There were just a few hundred too many millennial at this symposium for her liking, a little too much of that hormonal, fist-pumping ethos. On one hand, she was happy that Marcus’ business kept him young; it was good to be conversant with a world that accommodated Cannibal Corpse and A Place to Bury Strangers. But sometimes you just wanted to downshift, and right now Bonnie and Herman Manchester were her ticket.
</p>
<p>It turned out they owned a chain of five bookstores. This piqued her attention because Virago had originated as a web-based  enterprise designed to stores like theirs and Marcus’ out of business. “And yet, here we are,” Constance quipped, “strolling hand-in-hand with the enemy."</p>
<p>	Oh, we’re not out of the woods yet,” Bonnie countered. “And everyone tells us we must be crazy to even think about expanding, but we’re at that point where we can’t not expand. The customers are out there.”
</p>
<p>	“And we know how to find them,” said Herm. “I’d go as far to say we know how to find them better than Mr. Smathers does, even with his millions ‘n’ all.”
</p>
<p>	They specialized, they told her, in Mindfullness. It used to be called New Age; and before that Aquarian Age, and then, simply Spirituality. They’d started with a single store in St. Louis that was exclusively Christian. Then they’d branched out into other faiths. And now since most of the Recovery movement programs were adding a spiritual element, you had one door opening up on another. “And then Boom!” said Herman, “you call the whole shah-bang Mindfullness. We’ve been working this mine so long that we can pretty much predict where it’s going next, and what will take off and what won’t where our customers are concerned.”
</p>
<p>	They were getting ready to open their sixth store, this one in Stowe, Vermont. Constance found herself impressed with their grasp of details. These seemingly fuzzy-headed old hippies were two of the most meticulous thinkers she’d ever met. They knew so much about marketing that this rich smorgasbord of ideas that Derek Smathers had laid out  came up lacking.
</p>
<p>	“We were hoping there’d be better head-hunting,” Herman said. They were still looking for a manager for their new store, and none of these young tech types were anything close too what they wanted. They’d had their fill of wonder boys tatted out like Queequeg with MBAs and Silicon Valley on their resumes thinking they were ready to rule the world.
</p>
<p>	“I take it you’d prefer a more traditional type?” Constance ventured. “Someone with a solid retail background perhaps, experienced in dealing one-on-one with customers?”
</p>
<p>	“Absolutely,” said Bonnie. “You’d think it wouldn’t be that hard to find.”
</p>


<p>“But he, or she, could still be a young person?”</p>
<p>“Long as they had the sense God gave a goose,” Herman said.</p>
<p>“Well yes, young is all right,” Connie added cautiously, “but you should know this is strictly a franchise opportunity. The buy-in would be around fifty thousand.”</p>
<p>“Not a problem,” Constance said. “And let’s say this was someone who’d actually grown up in a family business. Let’s say they didn’t have a business degree as such, just a lifetime of hands –on experience --- “</p>
<p>Herman was hooked. “Ma’am, you’d better have someone specific in mind, or I’m liable to throw something atcha!”</p>
<p>“Well, I do,” she replied. “My stepdaughter . . .”</p>

<p>	In the course of their conversation, they had paid little attention to the waiters bringing water glasses, bread baskets, and cruets of oil and vinegar to the table. Constance looked around and noticed all the other tables looked occupied by now. So what was holding up Marcus?
</p>
<p>	“Excuse me,” she said, digging her cell phone out of her purse, then tapping the question mark four or five times. “Just checking in on my husband . . . “
</p>
<p>	A waiter then appeared and set plates in front of Constance, the Manchesters, and Marcus’ still empty setting, which they found themselves peering at quizzedly. What he had brought them did not look like food at all, rather more like a miniature tower crafted from a child’s construction toy. A closer look revealed it to be several types of seafood piled up into some ingenious interlocking scaffold. Every course which followed, though always exotic and delicious, was likewise almost aggressively vertical.
</p>
<p>Her phone buzzed. “On my way,” his message said. “He’s coming,” Constance told the couple. “We can start now, if you like.” Then she proceeded to gently sell the Manchesters on Marcus’ single offspring, choosing her words carefully to make the best impression. It was a subject on which she needed to tread carefully, as there were so many tripwires around their relationship. Johanna was the sole subject in her marriage capable of making both parties raise their voices. 
</p>
<p>Her phone buzzed again. The text said, “face time with mr big.” Her face must have registered a level of alarm she was unaware of because Bonnie and Herm leaned forward and asked if she were all right.
</p>
<p>Constance assured them it was nothing, even though the notion of Marcus talking with Derek Smathers, without her – without benefit of counsel – set off all sorts of alarms. She twisted around in her chair and scanned the room again, and this time she spotted him, striding quickly towards their table. The fact that he was smiling was not in itself any reassurance for Constance.
</p>
<p>The Manchesters recognized him, of course, as the last speaker they’d heard, and complimented him on his remarks while Constance introduced them. She could not help plunging into the question of what Smathers and he had been talking about.
</p>
<p>“He was complimenting me on our logo!” gushed Marcus with understandable pride. “He says it’s classic, it’s in a class with the Nike Swoosh! Wanted to know how we’d got it and who came up with it!”
</p>


<p>“That’s great!” said Marcus. “Why doncha sit right down and tell us all about it while we dig into this seafood a la Barrel O’ Monkeys!”
</p>
<p>Normally it would indeed be joyous news for Constance as well, but she now found herself in an excruciating double bind. Here she was, trying to speak well of Johanna, and in theory the introduction of the logo dovetailed into one of Johanna’s greatest accomplishments: Johanna had designed the bold, floating F formed out of  unspooling ribbon (or recording tape, if you prefer) which adorned the front of their store, their shopping bags, their receipts, and all of their ads. She had created it back when she’d been only a month into her first graphic arts class. Everyone had adored it, and Marcus had adapted it for his business without any hint of condescension or favoritism. And Constance had felt safe in believing that Johanna had finally, finally discovered her true calling and was settled now on a path to success.
</p>
<p>But then, in defiance of all logic and expectation, Johanna had dropped out of art school. To Constance, this was inexplicable, and seemed perverse as well, and self-destructive. It was the last thing in the world she needed to revisit now that she’d laid all this positive groundwork before the Manchesters. In fact, she should never have started down this road in the first place, she realized. Marcus would definitely not appreciate her talking about Johanna’s career issues in front of strangers. <span> What was I thinking??? </span> she moaned silently. It was as if one of her worst courtroom nightmares had come true.
</p>
<p>But she would salvage this somehow; she had to. In the gentlest of tones she now said to her husband, “that’s wonderful news, dear. But the Manchesters have been hearing all about your store for the last hour almost. They were telling me all about their ingenious and successful franchise before I hijacked the conversation with a side issue.” 
</p>
<p>“Oh, we don’t mind,” Bonnie said. “Now that we’ve got both parents here, it’d be a good time to ask how you felt about your daughter moving to Vermont.”
</p>
<p>A hush fell over the table. Constance planted her face into her hands. Marcus looked confused, and then said to her, “I think you need to bring me up to speed.”
</p>
<p>Herman laughed. “Would that be forty-five, or thirty-three and a third!” Then he laughed again and said, “would you believe there are full-grown adults who don’t even know what that means anymore?”
